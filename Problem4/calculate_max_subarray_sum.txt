1.3 Calculate maximum subarray sum

Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array.
For example, given the array [34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86], the max sum would be 137, since we would take the elements 42,14,-5 , and 86.
Given the array [-1,-2,-3], the max sum would be 0, since we would choose not to take any elements.

Do this in O(n) time.

Follow-up: What if the elements can wrap around?
e.g. given [8,-1,3,4], return 15
